            Listed on the Nav Bar are some of the many project I have created in python. They all have a step by step tutorial on how to create each project and can all be tested in the browser itself. The first one is an integral program which  finds an area under the curve. The curve is created by a function that is inputted. The seconds program is the Motion simulator and works by using real-life physics.
